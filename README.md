# BionicWalk

## Repository Overview

This repository will include datasets and code for the study "An Integrated Framework for Enabling Human-Level Movement in Bionic Limbs with Prospective Modeling."

## Folder Structure and Contents

* 'data/my_data': Contains a sample of the (reduced feature set) datasets used in the study. These datasets are derived from a transtibial amputee subject and cover three locomotion modes:
     * Level ground walking
     * Stair ascent
     * Stair descent
The data includes a reduced feature set for both training and testing purposes.

* Dataset Composition: We extract a feature subset of the  generated  prospective samples corresponding to the originals that we include for easy testing if required.
     * Original samples are marked as 'Actual=1'.
     * Samples generated using prospective rehearsal are marked as 'Actual=0'.
     * The reduced feature set samples created through prospective rehearsal are provided alongside the original data for comparative analysis.
     * Code: The included code is designed to work with these datasets for an idea of the overall process.
